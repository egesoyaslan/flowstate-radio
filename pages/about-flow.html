        <div class="flow-text">Flow state, often referred to as being "in the zone," is a psychological and emotional state characterized by intense focus, complete absorption, and heightened performance. When individuals enter a flow state, they experience a seamless and effortless connection between their actions and awareness, losing track of time and becoming fully immersed in the present moment.</div>
